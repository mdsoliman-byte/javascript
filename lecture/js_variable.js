// variable is a container just for value store 
// example: var num = 10 (var is a kyewords , num is a variable name , = is a operator , 10 is a variable value );

// javascript have 3 type variable kyewords , var, let , const , 
var num = 10; // var is a variable kyewords , num is a variable name , = is a operator , 10 is variable value 
let nums = 20; // let is a variable kewords , nums is a variable name , = is a assingment operator , 20 is a variable value 
const numb = 30; // const is a variable name , numb is a variable name , = is a assingment operator , 30 is variable value 

num = 40;

var price1 = 100;
var price2 = 3000;
var total = price1 + price2  // its a statment, (price1 + price2) its a expression
